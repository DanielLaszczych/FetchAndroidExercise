# Android Exercise for Fetch

A simple Android application that fetches a JSON file containing a list of items which is then displayed to the user after 
some processing. The application is built on the foundation of a view model framework to separate the network and UI
aspects of the application into their own components to showcase standard practice and a maintainable codebase.
